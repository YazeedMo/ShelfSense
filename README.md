# ShelfSense

Shelf Sense is a JavaFX application designed as a Library Management System. It was created as a personal project to practice Java programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, as well as to gain experience working with databases, specifically MySQL.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of Shelf Sense is to simulate the management of a library's inventory, loans, and user interactions. It provides functionality for both customers and librarians to interact with the system, allowing customers to browse available books, and return books, while librarians can manage loans and penalties. Additionally, managers have the capability to manage librarians by adding, removing, and editing their information.

## Why Development Stopped
Development of Shelf Sense was halted due to the decision to transition into web development. Upon encountering web development technolgies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java Spring, the decision was made to shift focus and delve into these new areas of learning.

## Future Considerations
Although development of Shelf Sense has ceased, the project remains a valuable learning experience. Future considerations may include revisiting the project to implement additional features, enhance existing functionality, or refactor code based on new knowledge and skills.
